CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 9: If a Suborigin makes a request, a response without an Access-Control-Allow-Suborigin header should fail and should output a reasonable error message.
CONSOLE ERROR: Fetch API cannot load http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/resources/cors-script.php?cors=false. Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://foobar_127.0.0.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 12: PASS: Fetch correctly failed
