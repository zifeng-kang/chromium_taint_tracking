  Check if the autoplay gesture override experiment works.  There are a lot
  of config options, so this test just runs all of them.

  The "results" table contains one row per config tested.
  == Test Inputs ==
  #      - config number, in case you'd like to run just one.
  Flags  - autoplay experiment setting being tested.
               a      - "foraudio"
               v      - "forvideo"
               V      - "ifviewport"
               P      - "ifpagevisible"
               M      - "ifmuted"
               p      - "playmuted"
               m      - "ifmobile"
               For example, vM means '-forvideo-ifmuted".
