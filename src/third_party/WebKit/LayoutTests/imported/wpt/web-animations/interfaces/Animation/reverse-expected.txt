This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS reverse() inverts playbackRate 
PASS reverse() starts to play when pausing animation 
PASS reverse() maintains the same currentTime 
PASS reverse() when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime > effect end 
PASS reverse() when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime < 0 
PASS reverse() when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime < 0 
PASS reverse() when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime > effect end 
PASS reverse() when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity 
PASS reverse() when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity 
PASS reverse() when playbackRate == 0 
FAIL Reversing an animation without an active timeline throws an InvalidStateError Animation is not defined
Harness: the test ran to completion.
