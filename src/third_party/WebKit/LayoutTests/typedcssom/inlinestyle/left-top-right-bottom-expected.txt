This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Setting left, top, right, bottom works with a SimpleLength 
PASS Setting left, top, right, bottom works with a Simple percentage 
PASS Setting left, top, right, bottom works with a CalcLength 
PASS Getting left works with a SimpleLength 
PASS Getting top works with a SimpleLength 
PASS Getting right works with a SimpleLength 
PASS Getting bottom works with a SimpleLength 
FAIL Getting left works with a simple percent assert_equals: expected function "function CSSSimpleLength() { [native code] }" but got function "function CSSStyleValue() { [native code] }"
FAIL Getting top works with a simple percent assert_equals: expected function "function CSSSimpleLength() { [native code] }" but got function "function CSSStyleValue() { [native code] }"
FAIL Getting right works with a simple percent assert_equals: expected function "function CSSSimpleLength() { [native code] }" but got function "function CSSStyleValue() { [native code] }"
FAIL Getting bottom works with a simple percent assert_equals: expected function "function CSSSimpleLength() { [native code] }" but got function "function CSSStyleValue() { [native code] }"
FAIL Getting left works with a simple percent assert_equals: expected function "function CSSCalcLength() { [native code] }" but got function "function CSSStyleValue() { [native code] }"

FAIL Getting right works with a simple percent assert_equals: expected function "function CSSSimpleLength() { [native code] }" but got function "function CSSStyleValue() { [native code] }"
FAIL Getting bottom works with a simple percent assert_equals: expected function "function CSSSimpleLength() { [native code] }" but got function "function CSSStyleValue() { [native code] }"
